# AO3 Vanity Script

A Tampermonkey userscript that adds Twitter search links to AO3 works, so you can easily find social media discussions about fics. Uses [twiiit.com](https://twiiit.com) for searching - no Twitter/X account required!

*Sorry not sorry for deadnaming X* üê¶

Other social media platforms coming soon.
